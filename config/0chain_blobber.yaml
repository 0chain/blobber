# min_lock_demand is value in [0; 1] range; it represents number of tokens the
# blobber earned even if a user will not read or write something
# to an allocation; the number of tokens will be calculated by the following
# formula

#     allocation_size * write_price * min_lock_demand

# when a blobber receive a rad request it looks for client's read pools
# the timeout if time before expiration of this tokens to treat the tokens
# as alive and can be used; for example, if tokens expire after a second,
# then blobber can't give them; but if the tokens expire after a hour then
# the blobber can perform reading (handle download request) and redeem all
# its read markers
