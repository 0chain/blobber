# Go-Mocket â€“ Go GORM & SQL Mocking Library

Go-Mocket is a library inspired by [DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock](https://github.com/DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock).

As an inspiration library, it is the implementation of [sql/driver](https://godoc.org/database/sql/driver) interface but at the same time it follows a different approach and only has a similar API.
This library helps to mock any DB connection with [jinzhu/gorm](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm), as it was the created to serve this purpose.

List of features in the library:

* Mock `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `SELECT`, `DELETE`
* Support for transactions
* 2 API's to use - `chaining` and via specifying a whole mock object
* Matching by prepared statements arguments
* You don't require to change anything inside your code to start using this library
* Ability to trigger exceptions
* Attach callbacks to mocked responses to add an additional check or modify a response

**NOTE**, Please be aware that driver catches SQL without DB specifics. Generation of queries is done by *SQL* package
